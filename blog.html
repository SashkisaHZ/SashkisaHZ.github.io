                        <p>Choosing to enroll in the HBO-ICT bachelor's program at HZ University of Applied Sciences in
                            Middelburg was a natural progression for me. I hold an MBO diploma as a Computer Technician
                            from Bulgaria, where I first discovered my passion for understanding and working with
                            technology. My curiosity has always driven me to explore how things work, from dismantling
                            gadgets to learning how to build and program them.

                            The HBO-ICT program at HZ UAS offers a comprehensive approach to technology and its
                            applications in the modern world. The curriculum's focus on practical skills, combined with
                            a strong theoretical foundation, aligns perfectly with my goal of becoming an IT
                            professional who is not only proficient in current technologies but also adaptable to future
                            advancements. Moreover, the program's emphasis on innovation and problem-solving matches my
                            desire to engage in projects that challenge me to think critically and creatively.

                            Middelburg, with its vibrant student community and supportive learning environment, is the
                            ideal place for me to develop my skills further. I am excited about the opportunities this
                            program provides for collaboration, real-world experience, and personal growth. My journey
                            into the world of technology has only just begun, and I am eager to see where it will take
                            me next at HZ university.</p>

                <p>My Journey into Programming: From Web Design to Coding Languages</p>
                <footer class="blog">
                    <details class="post-details">
                        <summary>Read more...</summary>
                        <p>Programming has always intrigued me—it's like solving a complex puzzle, where each piece fits
                            perfectly to create something functional and meaningful. My journey into programming began
                            with the basics of HTML and CSS, which I consider to be my foundational tools. These
                            languages opened the door to web development, allowing me to design and structure web pages.
                            I have a solid understanding of HTML and CSS, which has enabled me to create
                            well-structured, responsive websites with a clean design.

                            As I became more comfortable with web development, I decided to expand my skills beyond
                            front-end design and dive into more complex programming languages. This led me to explore
                            C#, C++, and Python, where I have gained basic experience. Each of these languages has its
                            unique strengths, and my experience with them has been a mix of self-learning and practical
                            application.
                            </br>
                            C# was my first step into more advanced programming. I started with simple console
                            applications, gradually moving on to more complex tasks like developing basic algorithms and
                            understanding object-oriented programming concepts. C# has been particularly interesting
                            because of its versatility and its use in developing various types of applications, from
                            desktop software to games using Unity.
                            </br>
                            With C++, I ventured further into understanding how programming interacts with hardware.
                            Although my experience is still at a basic level, I've grasped the capabilities it provides.
                            This language has taught me to think more critically about how code is executed behind the
                            scenes, making me appreciate the efficiency and optimisation aspects of programming.
                            </br>
                            As for Python, my experience is more limited. I've primarily used it to create basic "bots"
                            for music, which was a fun way to apply my programming knowledge in a practical context.
                            However, I recognize that I still have much to learn when it comes to Python's full
                            capabilities.
                            </br>
                            My experience with these languages, although still developing, has been invaluable in
                            shaping my understanding of programming. Each one has taught me different approaches to
                            solving problems and how to think logically and creatively. Moving forward, I plan to
                            continue building my skills in these languages while exploring new ones and expanding my
                            knowledge of software development.

                        <p>Understanding myself is crucial for growth. I pride myself on being highly organized and
                            skilled at scheduling, which helps me manage tasks and meet deadlines effectively.
                            Constructive feedback is something I value deeply, as it aids in my development, and I'm
                            passionate about solving complex problems.

                            However, I sometimes struggle with self-doubt regarding my achievements and can be overly
                            reliant on documentation, which can slow my progress. Despite these challenges, I see
                            tremendous opportunities in working for a great company near my family. Large projects
                            excite me rather than intimidate me, and I view obstacles as challenges to overcome, not
                            threats. This mindset drives me to constantly push my limits and achieve my goals.</p>

                        <p>ICT skills are known to be distributed unevenly across the population. In the early 2000s
                            numerous studies pointed
                            out that there exists a big digital divide between the genders. Women tended to have less
                            access to the internet, and if they did have access, they had fewer occasions to use it and
                            tended to use it for different reasons than males. According to Desjardins, the gap between
                            access and use has narrowed significantly over time, at least in developed economies.
                            Nowadays,
                            digital technologies generate opportunities for those who possess the level of ICT skills
                            demanded by
                            the labour market, but they limit the options for those who do not possess these skills or
                            have failed to
                            upgrade them accordingly. As the pace of innovation in ICT technologies accelerates and
                            their diffusion
                            increases, workers are coming under growing pressure to adjust continuously. Consequently,
                            we observe that job changes between different occupational
                            groups are rather rare, which supports the concepts of task-specific and occupation-specific
                            human
                            capital. Furthermore, individuals who possess strong ICT skills tend to have greater
                            opportunities in the labour market.
                            ICT skills increase the probability to progress towards a new job, and especially towards
                            jobs which are
                            characterised by ICT-intensive tasks. These jobs tend to be better paid and are more likely
                            to offer
                            permanent contracts. </p>
